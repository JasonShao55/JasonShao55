### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jason, this is my GitHub profile.

:books:	I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science.

ðŸ”­ I have also studied computer science and artificial intelligence foundations at University of Edinburgh.

ðŸ“« I have worked in SenseTime and ASML as a software engineer intern.

âš¡ I have high proficiency in plentiful toolkits/libraries/tools in C/C++, Python, MATLAB, MySQL, plus some experience in Java and Android SDK. Also I'm proficient in data science, maths modeling, algorithm implementation, machine learning, deep learning etc.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development, DevOps, theories of machine learning algorithms, implementations of deep learning methods in computer vision (Long-tailed classification, target detection etc.), working on Leetcode medium&hard problems, seeking my new internship.


ðŸ’¬ I love learning new things and improving my problem-solving skills.
