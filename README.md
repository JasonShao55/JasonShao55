### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kaze, this is my GitHub profile.

:books:	I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at Nanjing, China.

ðŸ”­ I have also studied informatics at University of Edinburgh.

ðŸ“« I have worked in SenseTime.Inc as a software engineer intern.

âš¡ I have high proficiency in plentiful toolkits/libraries/tools in C/C++, Python, MATLAB, MySQL, plus some experience in Java and Android SDK. Also I'm proficient in data science, maths modeling, algorithm implementation, machine learning etc.
